Challenge 14 Tech Blog

This Tech Blog application is a site for technology enthusiasts to publish their blog posts and comment on other posts as well.

In this initial deployment, the following has been completed:
1. Opening of the Tech Blog page will display a few posts which was populated using seeds.
2. The LOGIN link will take you to the login or sign up which is not functional at this time.
3. The DASHBOARD link is displayed in the header of the Tech Blog page, but is not functional at this time.

There will be more deployments to add the LOGIN/SIGNUP and DASHBOARD functionality.  Functionality to add and delete posts as well as comment on posts will be made available in future deployments
